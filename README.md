# Design and Validation of Safety IP
Design and Implementation of Functionally Safe Automotive SoC

## Introducton
The automotive industry is constantly evolving with the rapid integration of electronic systems into vehicles. These electronic systems are becoming increasingly complex and interconnected, ADAS, infotainment systems, and safety-critical functions such as braking and steering. While these systems bring numerous benefits to drivers and passengers, they also pose a significant safety challenge. The risk of hardware failure in these systems could result in serious accidents and harm to people. One of the primary solutions to mitigate this risk is the use of functionally safe automotive system-on-chip (SoC) designs. As shown in Fig, in-vehicle functional safety analysis is split into three levels of abstraction.
1. Vehicle level.
2. Component/ECU level and
3. Chipset/SoC level.
In this case study, we will focus on the design of the functional safety concept for the Automotive System on Chip (SoC) that is specifically intended to meet the ISO 26262 criteria.

This project presents the design and implementation of a functionally safe automotive SoC. The SoC was designed using advanced safety mechanisms and design techniques to meet the stringent safety requirements of modern vehicles. The paper will provide a detailed description of the design process, the selection of safety mechanisms, and the integration of these mechanisms into the SoC design.
