# Design and Validation of Safety IP
Design and Implementation of Functionally Safe Automotive SoC

## Introducton
The automotive industry is constantly evolving with the rapid integration of electronic systems into vehicles. These electronic systems are becoming increasingly complex and interconnected, ADAS, infotainment systems, and safety-critical functions such as braking and steering. While these systems bring numerous benefits to drivers and passengers, they also pose a significant safety challenge. The risk of hardware failure in these systems could result in serious accidents and harm to people. One of the primary solutions to mitigate this risk is the use of functionally safe automotive system-on-chip (SoC) designs. As shown in Fig, in-vehicle functional safety analysis is split into three levels of abstraction.
1. Vehicle level.
2. Component/ECU level and
3. Chipset/SoC level.
